    "Blogs are the richest source of information. However, much of the text information is redundant. Tech Mahindra takes up the job of designing a blog retrieval and summarization system where the goal is to retrieve the K least redundant blogs while returning the top-K search results.  \n",

    "You are a software developer at Tech Mahindra. Your Team is assigned the task of designing the blog search tool. To find the top K results, the team leader decides to use the plagiarism score as a metric for evaluation.  You are being asked to design a prototype for this tool using basic text processing techniques like edit distance and n-gram model considering the processing speed. Write a program for designing the plagiarism check tool. \n",
