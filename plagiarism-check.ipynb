    "You are a software developer at Tech Mahindra. Your Team is assigned the task of designing the blog search tool. To find the top K results, the team leader decides to use the plagiarism score as a metric for evaluation.  You are being asked to design a prototype for this tool using basic text processing techniques like edit distance and n-gram model considering the processing speed. Write a program for designing the plagiarism check tool. \n",
